  * Each question supports a question text, four distinct options (A, B, C, D), and a designated correct answer.  
* **Quiz Taking:** Users can attempt available quizzes and submit their answers.  
* **Automated Scoring:** The system automatically calculates the user's score immediately upon submission.  
* **Certificate Generation (PDF):**  
  * Generates a professional **Certificate of Achievement** in PDF format upon successful quiz completion.  
  * The certificate includes the user's name, quiz title, final score, and date of completion.  
* **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login for user access.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack**

* **Backend:** PHP (Laravel Framework)

cp .env.example .env  
php artisan key:generate

### **4\. Database Configuration**

Edit the .env file and update the database configuration details (DB\_DATABASE, DB\_USERNAME, DB\_PASSWORD).

\# .env file excerpt  
DB\_CONNECTION=mysql  
DB\_HOST=127.0.0.1  
DB\_PORT=3306  
DB\_DATABASE=quiz\_system\_db  
DB\_USERNAME=root
